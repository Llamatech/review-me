# Usability tests
We think that our users are of incredible importance, and this app is made for them.
That's why we made some usability tests to help us improve as much as we can.

## Usability test one
We told the user to get on the page, which he'd never used before, and add one
of his Github projects. This was the result.

We confirmed that telling our user to login before adding a project is needed.
Moreover, he could easily explore the page and read the instructions, although
we could make an additional button for the login in the page.

He tried to go back using the logo, which wasn't working, so we changed that
to work the same way as the button "Back to dashboard".

## Usability test two
We told our user to find a project with more than 10 stars and add a review and
a rating to it, and to find a project with the name "meteor" on it. This was the result.

He told us it was confusing to find where to comment and rate. As the current button
only says "Learn more", it is not obvious that's where he needed to go to rate and
review the project. He told us the search bar was very obvious and easy to find,
as were the filters for the project's stats. He tried to go back to the dashboard using
the logo, so it's probably a good idea to make it go back to the dashboard. We noticed
there was an error with the ratings, which we were able to correct.

# Experts consultation
A consultation with developers, our target audience, revealed a couple mistakes we'd made.
They felt that the text in the homepage was too long, and revealed little. We redesigned it
to still let the user know our purpose and the way the webpage works, but in a much more 
readable way. They also told us to make it obvious that a review and comment were only 
allowed when the user was logged in, and to tell as much to a user who wasn't.
