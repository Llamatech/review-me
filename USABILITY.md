#Usability tests
We think that our users are of incredible importance, and this app is made for them.
That's why we made some usability tests to help us improve as much as we can.

##Usability test one
We told the user to get on the page, which he'd never used before, and add one
of his Github projects. This was the result.

We confirmed that telling our user to login before adding a project is needed.
Moreover, he could easily explore the page and read the instructions, although
we could make an additional button for the login in the page.

##Usability test two
We told our user to find a project with more than 10 stars and add a review and
a rating to it, and to find a project with the name "meteor" on it. This was the result.

He told us it was confusing to find where to comment and rate. As the current button
only says "Learn more", it is not obvious that's where he needed to go to rate and
review the project. He told us the search bar was very obvious and easy to find,
as were the filters for the project's stats.
