The Internet Project Database - A system to review and rate FOSS projects hosted on Github


To run this project you need to run both the backend and the front end. Additionally, you need tonhave an instance of a mongodb running. The paths for the mongodb url and the backend url are handld with eniroment variables in the system: MONGO_URL and BACK_URL. After setting these variables and running your mongodb instance you need to run both the front end and the backend. To do it, navigate to the backend folder from your favorite console and run`npm install` to get the necessary dependencies and then `npm start` to run the application. Repeat this process for the frontend. Once all three things are running, you can access the application at localhost:8080.

You can see the application running at: http://review-me.margffoy-tuay.com
